# Coldplay or the truth about music for me

Look I don't understand all this hate. In fact I hate hate. Pretty much made me gave up on all of you haters (Trump).

This song represent my dreams to a T. All the good fantasies I had to stop the pain of being alive.

It is an example of postivie music. Many haters think that hip hop is cool. It is not, it is a genre, ask your favirote hip hop artist what he thinks of this Coldplay song https://goo.gl/tZAnQv. If they are worth their weight in gold, like my favirote rapper Common. Then they will deck you for asking that question. So Dear White People, FUCK OFF!!

So take another listen.

It is okay to like positive music. Just turn your radio back to the 60's and cry.

Watch this if you are racist.
